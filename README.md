# Parking Lot App

> Parking structures are integral to various public spaces such as retail centers, sports arenas, and business districts, offering a range of parking options for different vehicle categories. These facilities are designed to accommodate a specific number of vehicles and charge fees based on the duration of parking. Upon entry, drivers receive a parking ticket, which is used to track the parking time. When it's time to exit, payment can be made either at an automated payment terminal or with a parking attendant using a card or cash.
